			Dear Colleagues,  <br />
			I don't know all of you but I'm a JPL employee in the robotics group. I am participating in the 2019 MORE THAN PINK Walk on September 22nd to raise money in the fight against breast cancer. 
			Like many of you, this disease has struck close to home. 
			Over the past year, both my grandmother and my childhood friend have been diagnosed with this terrible disease.  
		</p>

		<p>
			And so I'm asking for donations. I'm not used to, and frankly hate, asking for money, but I know this is not for me. 
			This is for all of the women in our lives and ALL donations will help fund the research and treatment of breast cancer.
		</p>

		<p>
			My goal is to raise $3,000. You can help! Click the link at the end of this email to go to my personal fundraising <span style="color:blue; text-decoration:underline">webpage</span>, or reply to this email and I'll send you a donation form.
		</p>

		<p>
			Thank you, thank you, thank you!<br />
			Emanuela Palombo

		<p>
			Here is the correct link to my <span style="color:blue; text-decoration:underline">webpage</span>.
			There is some more information on there if you'd like to take a look, but let me know if you'd like to set up a time to chat to discuss further.

		<p>
			Thank you!<br />

		<p>
			Hi What should I do now? Thanks

	<div>
		<h4>Agent:</h4>
				<blockquote>

		<p>
			If you visit my <span style="color:blue; text-decoration:underline">webpage</span>, there is more information as well as a link to donate. Does that answer your question?

			Thanks!<br />

	<div>
		<h4>Bot:</h4>
				<blockquote>

		<p>
			Hi Thanks for getting in contact with me. Can you tell me why I should visit webpage? Is this <span style="color:blue; text-decoration:underline">link the right one</span>? Regards
		</p>
							</blockquote>

	</div>

	<div>
		<h4>Agent:</h4>
				<blockquote>

		<p>
			That link isn't right; try <span style="color:blue; text-decoration:underline">this</span> one. There is a link on there which will take you to a donations page, which is probably the easiest option if you're interested!
		</p>
